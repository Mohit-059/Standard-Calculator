Standard calculator with keyboard inputs and shortcuts supported
i.e: 0-9 digits via numpad, x or X for multiplication, / for division , backspace for removing last element of a character, C to clear the expression as well as the result.

The calculator also has memory functions just like a standard calculator i.e(MS- memory storage, M+&M- - Memory =/-, MR - memory Recall, MC - memory Clear)

This calculator also supports short term history button which when clicked shows all the expressions and their respective results.


Still under process to integrate Scientific calculator, convertors etc..
