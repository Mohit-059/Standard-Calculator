Standard calculator with keyboard inputs and shortcuts supported
i.e: 0-9 digits via numpad, x or X for multiplication, / for division , backspace for removing last element of a character, C to clear the expression as well as the result.

The calculator also has memory functions just like a standard calculator i.e(MS- memory storage, M+&M- - Memory =/-, MR - memory Recall, MC - memory Clear)

This calculator also supports short term history button which when clicked shows all the expressions and their respective results.


Still under process to integrate Scientific calculator, convertors etc..

Do check out the main website too (MgPortfolio) to know about more projects and also do fill out the feedback form there.

-> Steps to install and run :-
1.Download the zip file (prefered) or create a git clone taking reference from any youtube tutorial
2.Extract the files
3.& just run index.html file

And Done !!

(if u face any kind of trouble while running this file, it could be due to the extensions not installed or supported,
one solution for this could be open the folder in vscode and after installing the req. extensions(html,css,js support and live server) try running index.html again via live server)

Thanks for reading it !
Enjoy !!
